<p>“<a href="http://www.azquotes.com/quote/1067329?ref=moats">In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable 'moats'”.</a>&nbsp;– Warren Buffett</p>
<p>You can tell a deep value&nbsp;credit person a mile away.&nbsp; We almost always cite Warren Buffett as our wannabe mentor.&nbsp; We like nothing better than investing in strong boring businesses that provide a&nbsp;necessary function with solid long-term management teams, thoughtful strategies and reasonable balance sheets.&nbsp; We have a mantra on our desk "boring is good".&nbsp; Even beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most business books are unreadably awful but I loved Buffett's biography,&nbsp;"The Snowball", and my dad's favourite book by Buffett's mentor,&nbsp;Benjamin Graham, "The Intelligent Investor". If you only read two business books...</p>
<p>With that in mind and not owning either the shares or the bonds, I checked out Tesla CEO&nbsp;Elon Musk's remarkable Q1 conference call the other day for entertainment.&nbsp;In it, after a while,&nbsp;he basically blew off a couple of Wall Street&nbsp;analysts and went to twitter crowdsourced investor questions.&nbsp;Now I've been listening to dry conference calls for 25 years and the general sycophancy that comes with it:&nbsp;"Great quarter guys!" and my personal favourite just&nbsp;prior to the GFC "uh,&nbsp;given&nbsp;you are, uh, arguably underlevered...". With no skin in the game, I found Musk's remarks less stunning than news outlets made them&nbsp;and in tune with my own views that the investing landscape could do with a freshening up.&nbsp; But it was his antithetical to Buffett's&nbsp;view on moats that struck me most.&nbsp; And, reluctantly, I think there might be some truth in it.</p>
<p>"First of all, I think moats are lame," Musk said. "They're like nice in a sort of quaint, vestigial way. But if your only defence against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace of innovation. That is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness."</p>
<p>When I look back on the mistakes I've made investing it's being either too early – great being underweight but why on earth did I lend to any of those telecom start-ups at all?&nbsp; Or a&nbsp;too rear-view approach - local business owners need to keep&nbsp;advertising in the (boring, stable)&nbsp;Yellow Pages right?&nbsp;Anchoring bias.&nbsp; Got to love it.&nbsp; However, I've also been lucky to have spent most of my career investing at a time that has seen the vast consolidation of multiple industries from an average of six players to three. That has given a whole host of companies moat-like pricing power and has made for a great investing environment for a deep value credit investor.&nbsp; So it’s quite a mind-shift to believing that those moats are now only illusory.&nbsp; Or at least not wholly so.</p>
<p>That's because the pace of change is accelerating so fast that larger consolidated&nbsp;companies may finally be at a disadvantage in their inability to adapt fast enough.&nbsp; When 5G telephony is rolled out, the value of that precious cable connection into the home is going to come down fast.&nbsp; Yes, you can consolidate with wireless telcos but that only holds back the barbarian armies for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tech and pharma&nbsp;giants recognise this and have been using their&nbsp;considerable balance sheets to&nbsp;buy the competition.&nbsp; I do wonder if this will continue to be a successful strategy as we accelerate ever faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;One&nbsp;of the other&nbsp;moats is the ever-growing cost of compliance that larger companies can amortise over a larger revenue base.&nbsp;However, that cost is coming down fast now as nimble tech start-up&nbsp;businesses help&nbsp;automate previously cumbersome processes, eliminating bureaucracy.&nbsp; Will the larger companies be able to keep up with a level playing field?</p>
<p>Finally, in the war for ideas and talent, the smart kids nowadays just&nbsp;aren't that into hierarchies, suits and ties and working their way up the corporate ladder in companies who feel they have some metaphorical moat that gives them time to adapt.&nbsp; The up-and-coming generation know they don’t have that luxury but will they?</p>
