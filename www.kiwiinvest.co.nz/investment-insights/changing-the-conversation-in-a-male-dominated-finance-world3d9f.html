<h2>Hello, Mr Bond: how do we shake and stir the status quo?</h2>
<p>Bond funds are collections or portfolios of loans issued by governments or companies that give you an income in retirement and generally form the lower risk part of your investments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to who runs these portfolios, the numbers of women involved are pitiful.</p>
<p>According to the news service Bloomberg, there is a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/female-bond-fund-managers-win-on-returns-as-they-fight-for-jobs">slight advantage to bond funds being run by women</a>, yet only 2.5% of funds are run solely by female bond portfolio managers with some 17.5% of bond funds run by female co-managers (i.e. they run it with a man).&nbsp; So while our advantage has been proven,&nbsp;our representation doesn’t look like it’s getting better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Women also scarcely attend – when are we?</h2>
<p>Sitting here in New York writing this, I’m reflecting on two industry conferences I recently attended that depressingly had no more than 15% female attendees, though there was a higher proportion of female presenters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seemed exceedingly unlikely to me that the room was represented by the best bond investors.</p>
<p>I mean take actuaries, the people who work on pension calculations, who – to qualify – really need to understand the maths behind the bond markets. &nbsp;If you know anything about actuarial science, the exams are extremely hard. &nbsp;Now, if almost 40% of qualified actuaries are women (and I doubt that many of us bond managers male or female could pass the actuarial exams), surely there are other women with bond maths capable of working as bond portfolio managers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sound and fury signifying nothing?</h2>
<p>When I&nbsp;was working in London and New York, you didn’t want to be identified as *<strong>that</strong>* woman.&nbsp; Don’t be too opinionated.&nbsp; That was “arrogant”, not decisive.&nbsp; There was surely no path to promotion for raising your head above the parapet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, I attended “women in investing” functions and diversity days.&nbsp; But my heart always sank at the cocktail receptions afterwards where women in two-piece suits, kitten heels and pearls, and beautifully-coiffed hair networked with each other, probably knowing that not much good would come out of this.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the participants didn’t even actually run the portfolios and instead worked to explain portfolios to investors.&nbsp; Frankly, it all felt deeply inauthentic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Changing the conversation</h2>
<p>A few months ago, I took a few baby steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt it was necessary to say something about how rare we are as a response to the brave young women of New Zealand and the rest of the world who are taking a stand in the #metoo debate (and, by the way, sadly #metoo.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I posted about it on LinkedIn in a personal capacity and asked my fixed income friends to like or comment.&nbsp; The result was pleasantly surprising.&nbsp; Sure, there was the obligatory dinosaur comment, but the world didn’t end, and I got some decent responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also made me think that as guardians of your future we absolutely cannot end the debate there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How we can make the change</h2>
<p>Given how fast technology is transforming business models I think we need all kinds of minds in investment management to get the best outcomes for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That doesn’t just stop at our own hiring practices.&nbsp; We have been considering diversity when looking at investing some of your money in funds outside of the Kiwi Wealth team to round out your nest egg.&nbsp; &nbsp;We need to shine a new light on those teams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Focusing on diversity</h2>
<p>It’s not just the women we have been asking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s an easy, if still an uncomfortable, question for too many people that pitch their products to us. &nbsp;But how about the diversity of economic backgrounds or ethnic backgrounds?&nbsp; How do they bring on new staff?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do they, for instance, consider neurodiversity? That shy chap who doesn’t make eye contact with autism may be a perfect analyst if you give him a chance to show you what he is capable of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these fund managers aren’t very diverse now, what do they expect to look like in five years’ time?&nbsp; No one wants quotas, but I would like to see every effort to eliminate unconscious bias – not just against women.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You deserve no less.</p>
